    "Altering the stride hyperparameter in convolutional layers affects the spatial dimensions of the output feature maps. A larger stride value reduces the size of the feature maps, while a smaller stride increases their size. It's a trade-off between computational efficiency and preserving spatial information. Smaller strides result in more spatial detail but require more computation, while larger strides reduce detail but are computationally more efficient."
